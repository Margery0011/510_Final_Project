### Plot Vignette

- 1. MA- Plot

`plotMA` shows the log2 fold changes attributable to a given variable over the mean of normalized counts for all the samples in the DESeqDataSet


the plotMA function is used to plot the histogram of mean of Normalized Counts. If the adjusted P value is less than 0.1, the color is marked.Whatever exceeds it is marked as a triangle

X ï¼š Mean of Normalized Counts

Y : Log Fold Change
