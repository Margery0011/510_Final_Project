### Plot Vignette

- 1. MA- Plot

`plotMA` shows the log2 fold changes attributable to a given variable over the mean of normalized counts for all the samples in the DESeqDataSet


the plotMA function is used to plot the histogram of mean of Normalized Counts. If the adjusted P value is less than 0.1, the color is marked.Whatever exceeds it is marked as a triangle

  - res

`plotMA(res, ylim=c(-2,2))`

  - resLFC 

`plotMA(resLFC, ylim=c(-2,2))`

`resLFC` directly removes the noise associated with LFC from low-expressed genes without the need to manually set the threshold


  - different Types

`apeglm `is the adaptive t prior shrinkage estimator from the apeglm package (Zhu, Ibrahim, and Love 2018). As of version 1.28.0, it is the default estimator.

`ashr` is the adaptive shrinkage estimator from the ashr package (Stephens 2016). Here DESeq2 uses the ashr option to fit a mixture of Normal distributions to form the prior, with method="shrinkage".

`normal` is the the original DESeq2 shrinkage estimator, an adaptive Normal distribution as prior.

`type='apeglm` and `type='ashr'` have shown to have less bias than `type='normal'`
